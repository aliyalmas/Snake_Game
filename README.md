# Snake_Game
The Snake Game I developed during my second year of engineering is a simple yet engaging project that demonstrates fundamental concepts of game development using Python. The game is built with **Python** and utilizes the **Pygame library** to handle graphics and game logic. The player controls a snake that moves in a grid-based environment, consuming food to grow in length while avoiding collisions with itself and the screen borders. The game starts with a small snake that moves in a predefined direction, and the player can change its course using keyboard inputs. Each time the snake eats food, its length increases, and the score is updated accordingly. The game's mechanics rely on an **event-driven approach**, where keypress events determine the snake's movement. The **game loop** ensures smooth motion, checks for collisions, and continuously updates the display. **Randomization** is used to generate food at different locations on the screen, making the gameplay dynamic. The project also features a simple **score system** that keeps track of the player's performance. Overall, this project helped me strengthen my understanding of **game logic, event handling, and real-time graphics**, while also enhancing my Python programming skills in a fun and interactive way.
